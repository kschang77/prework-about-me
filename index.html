      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a software engineer in the middle of a bootcamp skill refresh, in order to get back into the tech field. Well, that's 
        the short version. The slightly longer version is I've been out of tech for over a decade and my skill set is no longer
        relevant, even though I knew the fundamentals quite well. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've been living in California for several decades, and I am a US Citizen. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my spare time, I play some PC games, read some books, and indulge in my last tech fad, whiich is currently Node.js 
          and Python. I just finished some introductory IT Technical Support, Data Science and Cybersecurity courses, but I've
          been know to fixate on some other topics. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Probably a mix of tech support, web developement, cybersecurity, and data science. I'm interested in all these areas. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Right now I'm living in San Francisco, in the middle of Chinatown. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I was once, I will be again. Back in the days, I used to code HTML by hand. I had an AOL screenname that was only four 
       letters long. That's how long I've been online. In fact, I was on AOL before AOL existed. Not that you kids know 
       what AOL is any way. </p>
