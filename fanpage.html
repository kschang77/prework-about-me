    <P>The band started in 1975 in Australia, but nobody wanted to take a chance on them. Not even opening for 
        Rod Stewart was able to help them crack the American music scene... Eventually their persistence paid off. They 
        cracked the Australia Top Ten in 1980, and their music was finally heard by Clive Davis of Arista Records. 
        And the rest is history. Forty years later, they are still touring. </P>
